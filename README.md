# Yabe Online Auction

Yabe Online Auction requires its sellers to post items for sale for a six-week period during which the price of any unsold item drops 12 percent each week. For example, an item that costs $10.00 during the first week costs 12 percent less, or $8.80 during the second week. In the third week, the same item is 12 percent less than $8.80, or $7.74.

Design an application that allows a user to input prices until an appropriate sentinel value is entered. Program output is the price of each item during each week, one through six.
